FUNDAMENTAL FEATURES
Each group must implement the following classes: Bank (with the main method),
Customer, and Account. Essential features are mandatory, including:
1. Account Information (e.g. how many accounts, account numbers, etc)
2. Balance Check (e.g. remain balance, available balance, etc)
3. Money Transfer (e.g. inter-account transfer, third-party transfer, etc), and
4. Settings (e.g. transfer limit, overseas withdraw limit, etc)

ADVANCED FEATURES
Each group is also required to implement three additional classes. You need to
study, plan, and propose the objects so that they can be effectively utilized by
the assigned groups. This is a black-box experiment, and each group will be
randomly assigned four to eight classes for your implementation use. You are
required to justify the design of the objects and critically analyse the pros and
cons of the objects. Advanced objects include:
1. Branch
2. (System)Security
3. Loan
4. CreditCard
5. CurrencyExchange, and
6. Insurance

BLACKBOX EXPERIMENT AND COMPONENT SUBMISSION
Each group is tasked with designing three additional classes (advanced features)
after the allocation of components. The group will have two opportunities to
submit their outputs, which should include (a) the class file and (b) the Javadoc
document. Submissions must be made before the deadline following the
instructions provided.
The design to have two submissions aims to provide more time for programmers
to understand others' designs during the first submission, allowing for
appropriate upgrades to both the components and the overall system design in
the second submission. The process is illustrated below:
1. The group is allocated three components for design, such as Loan,
CreditCard, and Branch.
2. The group conducts background studies on how these components
function in real life and designs them based on the study. Outputs at this
stage should include class files with Javadoc documentation.
3. After the first submission is closed, the group receives class files from
random teams that are not listed in their allocated components. In this
example, it could be FX, Insurance, and (System)Security. The group is
required to enhance their system design by incorporating these additional
components.
4. After the second submission, the group receives another round of
component updates. The group should also upgrade their allocated
components and submit them if necessary.
5. The group is expected to engage in in-depth discussions about the
component design, including those they implemented in the system, in
the report writing.
